;; FundingCircle.jackdaw.streams/process! fn when passed a ^KStream invokes
;; FundingCircle.jackdaw.streams.lambdas/processor-supplier which takes in a processor-fn and applies that
;; fn as the body of the process method of a concrete implementation of the org.apache.kafka.streams.processor.Processor IFace
;; (see FnProcessor type in FundingCircle.jackdaw.streams.lambdas). This is handy, but it does not work if you want to define
;; your own implementation of the Kafka Processor IFace. An example of a problem with the FundingCircle.jackdaw FnProcessor
;; type is that it does not allow you to define any scheduled (punctuated) callbacks in the init method since that
;; method is already 'pre-defined'. For poi listings enrichment we need to define a scheduled callback to act as a batch timeout,
;; so below we implement our own processor fn that calls a handrolled processor-supplier.
